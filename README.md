# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning models. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the development of predictive models to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic. The primary objective is to identify the key factors contributing to diabetes and build a robust prediction system.

## Workflow
### 1. Data Exploration
- Analyzed dataset structure and identified missing values.
- Visualized the distribution of key features using histograms and boxplots.
- Examined relationships between features using correlation heatmaps.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Imputed missing values with domain-specific techniques.
- Scaled numerical features using standardization for improved model performance.

### 3. Machine Learning
- Implemented multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### 4. Visualization
- Visualized feature importance for each model.
- Plotted ROC curves to compare model performance.
- Presented insights using easy-to-understand charts.
